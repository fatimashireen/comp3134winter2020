 1.In first scheme php script queries an correct value and returns column values for the row and the data related to that user is visible now.

2.The query returned the same values as if the name was passed normally.When I add the extra sign the search parameters had extra characters in it.It does affect on database.

3. I think this will return all the rows in the table.But this was not the case  when I put Benâ€™ or 1=1 I have single quotes around the varible inside the php script.
